## Multiple algorithms using recursion.

## firstIndex
Finds the value in the array and returns the first index of where it was found.

## palindrome
Takes in an array and recursively checks if it is a palindrome or not.

## storeNum
Takes in an array and stores the value provided by the user in an array and in a vector.

## replaceWithX
Takes input from the user and swittches all 'a's entered with an 'x'

## mergeSort
Merge sort algorithm uses recursion to sort in descending order array in main function

## quickSort
Implemented the quick sort algorithm to arrange in ascending order an array of integers.
